# AskAustria

This should be an evaluation Website for austria. every austrian IP can vote once per pole and everyone can vote without an account.
We don't save personal data except what was voted und indepenendtly from that which IP voted. This is only to check if
someone is still elligable for voting or already gave his/her/its voice.

There is an authentication planned but only if enough people need it (one Router per house -> only one can vote (if this should happen, write to us so we know such a feature is wanted, beware we might need to authenticate that you are somehow austrian))

Anyone with an Austrian IP can once a week (or other timeframe, still needs to be discussed) post a question that he wants to know
how other austrians think about it.
